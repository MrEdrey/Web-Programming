# Math Challenge PHP Scripts

This repository contains PHP scripts that solve three different programming challenges. Each challenge is implemented in multiple versions to demonstrate the step-by-step development process and improvements over time.

## Activity A: Weighted Grade Computation

**ðŸ“‹ Description:**  
The user inputs four grades and their corresponding weights. The program calculates the weighted average and prints the final grade.

### ðŸ”¹ Version 0.1
- Basic implementation using direct input and calculation.
- No input checks.

**How works:**
- The program reads 8 inputs (grade followed by its weight).
- Calculates the weighted average.
- Displays the result of the calculation (one decimal precision).

**Input exemple:**

10 *(Grade)*\
3 *(Weight)*\
10\
4\
...

### ðŸ”¹ Version 0.2
- Code improved using a while loop.

### ðŸ”¹ Version 0.3
- It is now possible to calculate the grade for multiple students, and also to separate them by name.

**How works:**
- Read the first input, which is the number of students.
- Then, the program reads 2 inputs: their name and the number of grades.
- Next, the program reads 8 inputs (a grade followed by its weight, repeated 4 times).
- It calculates the weighted average.
- The result is displayed with one decimal place.
- If there are more students, the program returns to the beginning.

**Input exemple:**

2 *(Number of students)*\
Alex 1 *(Student name and number of grades)*\
5 *(Grade)*\
3 *(Weight)*\
7\
4\
10\
3\
9\
4\
Ana 2\
10\
3\
10\
4\
...

### ðŸ”¹ Version 0.3
- Version 0.4 includes improved input handling and better support for multiple subjects.

**How works:**
- Start by entering the number of students.
- Enter the studentâ€™s name and the number of subjects they have, separated by a space.
- Enter the subject name followed by 8 values: 4 grades and their respective weights.
- Repeat the process for all students and all their subjects.

**Input exemple:**

2 *(Number of students)*\
Ana_Silva 2 *(Student name and number of grades)*\
MatemÃ¡tica 7 2 8 2 9 2 10 2 *(Subject and its respective grades/weights)*\
PortuguÃªs 6 3 5 2 7 2 8 3\
Bruno_Costa 2\
HistÃ³ria 5 2 6 2 7 3 8 3\
Geografia 9 2 8 1 10 3 7 2 \
 
**Output exemple**
 
Student: Ana_Silva \
Subjects: 2\
MatemÃ¡tica #1: 8.5\
PortuguÃªs #2: 6.6 \
 
Student: Bruno_Costa \
Subjects: 2\
HistÃ³ria #1: 6.7\
Geografia #2: 8.8\
