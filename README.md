# Math Challenge PHP Scripts

This repository contains PHP scripts that solve three different programming challenges. Each challenge is implemented in multiple versions to demonstrate the step-by-step development process and improvements over time.

## Activity A: Weighted Grade Computation

**ðŸ“‹ Description:**  
The user inputs four grades and their corresponding weights. The program calculates the weighted average and prints the final grade.

### ðŸ”¹ Version 0.1
- Basic implementation using direct input and calculation.
- No input checks.

**How works:**
- The program reads 8 inputs (grade followed by its weight).
- Calculates the weighted average.
- Displays the result of the calculation (one decimal precision).

**Input exemple:**

10 (Grade)\
3 (Weight)\
10\
4\
...

### ðŸ”¹ Version 0.2
- Code improved using a while loop.

### ðŸ”¹ Version 0.3
- It is now possible to calculate the grade for multiple students, and also to separate them by name.

**How works:**
- Read the first input, which is the number of students.
- Then, the program reads 2 inputs: their name and the number of grades.
- Next, the program reads 8 inputs (a grade followed by its weight, repeated 4 times).
- It calculates the weighted average.
- The result is displayed with one decimal place.
- If there are more students, the program returns to the beginning.

**Input exemple:**

2 (Number of students)\
Alex 1 (Student name and number of grades)\
5 (Grade)\
3 (Weight)\
7\
4\
10\
3\
9\
4\
Ana 2\
10\
3\
10\
4\
...
